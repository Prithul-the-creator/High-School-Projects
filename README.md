All of the following code files are some fun projects I did in high school, some of my more serious projects were either done in game engines or I don't have access to due to company rules but these projects were still pretty cool and I had a lot of fun doing them :)

In order, here are the following descriptions

1. A [cold email bot](https://github.com/Prithul-the-creator/EmailBot/blob/main/send_emails.py) that I used to reach out to professors instead of individually writing emails, saved me days of effort. Sent around 1000 emails in a few minutes and successfully got research opportunities
2. A [labeling tool](https://github.com/Prithul-the-creator/EmailBot/blob/main/send_emails.py) that can take any audio and accurately segment it into different speakers
